YOLO-bot
==========

Perhaps the second dumbest idea I've ever had.

Promo
- Smart camera application. Add smart "vision" to your camera, connect what you "see" to Apple Shortcuts.

Description
- YOLObot uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize the world around you and take action. YOLObot is a smart camera app that allows you to recognize everyday objects and quickly take common actions like dialing a phone number, looking up products barcodes, getting directions to an address, or even launching a fitness app to record what you're eating. 

- The secret is YOLObot's ability to leverage CoreML to recognize over 500 objects, and linking the "smart camera" to Apple Shortcuts.
